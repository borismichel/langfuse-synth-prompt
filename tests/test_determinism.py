"""Determinism golden gate — same (seed, target_traces, params) => byte-identical Spool.

A fresh full-payload materialization is compared byte-for-byte against the blessed golden,
run offline in a subprocess under PYTHONHASHSEED=0 and the deny-LLM egress block. This
simultaneously proves the seed is deterministic AND model-free-at-seed-runtime. `synth new`
blessed the initial golden, so this is green from the first commit.

The oracle is pinned at a small `GOLDEN_TARGET_TRACES` floor: determinism is
scale-independent, so a tiny committed golden proves the law while staying reviewable.
Re-bless a deliberate pool change (never a hand-edit) with:

    synth-authoring freeze golden_seed:seed \\
        --golden tests/golden/prompt_spool.ndjson \\
        --target-traces 24 --search-path tests --search-path src
