"""Per-run anchors — the state `synth seed` writes and every later reader trusts.

A seed run resolves facts nobody else can reconstruct (the target instance, the resolved
project, the volumes actually spooled). This kit records them in `.synth_state.json` via
the core anchors mechanism, so `verify`, `script`, and the live surface can never drift
from the seeded data. The rules — the file, its location (`SYNTH_STATE_DIR`, i.e. the
spool volume), the read-only-mount transport into live surfaces, seed as the only writer
— are the Contract's (`langfuse-synth-core` `CONTRACT.md` §"Per-run anchors (opt-in)").

The IO (locate/save/load/exists) is core's `AnchorsIO`; the FIELDS below are this kit's
territory — grow them with the story (example trace ids, prompt versions, headline
figures), and the portal never parses them.
