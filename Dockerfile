# Reference Dockerfile for a Demo Depot synth kit (non-root uid/gid 10001).
# Mirrors langfuse-synth-core/examples/kit.Dockerfile. langfuse-synth-core is a PUBLIC git
# dependency pinned in pyproject.toml, so the install is a plain HTTPS pip install — no
# build secret.
#
# Build:  docker build -t prompt:dev .

FROM python:3.12-slim

# git: python:*-slim ships without it, but pip needs it to fetch the git-pinned lib.
# The repo is public, so this is a plain HTTPS fetch — no build secret required.

# COPY lands root-owned, but the container runs as uid 10001 (JOB_RUN_USER). Create and
# chown the two runtime write paths — the spool and the artifact dir the portal collects
# from (CONTRACT.md §"Filesystem conventions") — or `seed` dies on open_spool() at the
# first deployment.

# No default CMD: the portal supplies the command at container-create time
# (CONTRACT.md §"The container invocation").
